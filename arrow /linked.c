/*
 * Linked list
 * In linked list implementations, the arrow operator
 * is used to traverse through the nodes by accessing the next nodeâ€™s address.
 *
 * In the linked list example, head is a pointer to a Node type,
 * and head->data and head->next are used to access members of the structure.
 *
 * The arrow operator -> is vital in managing objects and structures
 * through pointers, especially in complex data structures.
 * It ensures code readability by providing a clear and concise way
 * to dereference pointers when accessing member elements, encapsulating
 * the dereference operation (*ptr). into a straightforward ptr-> expression.
