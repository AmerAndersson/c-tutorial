The numbers provided represent the first seven rows of Pascal's Triangle. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients. Each row represents the coefficients of the binomial expansion for increasing powers of ${(a + b)^n}$

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how Pascal's Triangle is constructed and how to interpret the provided rows:

### Construction of Pascal's Triangle:
1. **Starting Point:** The top of the triangle is a single "1". This is considered row 0.
2. **Row Construction:** Each subsequent row starts and ends with the number "1".
3. **Middle Elements:** The elements between the "1"s in each row are calculated as the sum of the two elements directly above them from the previous row.

### Detailed Breakdown:
1. **Row 0:**
   - 1

   This represents  ${(a + b)^0 = 1}$

  

2. **Row 1:**
   - 1 1

   This represents ${(a + b)^1 = a + b }$

3. **Row 2:**
   - 1 2 1

   This represents ${(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 }$

   - The "2" in the middle is the sum of the two "1"s above it from the previous row.

4. **Row 3:**
   - 1 3 3 1

   This represents ${(a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3 }$
   - The "3"s in the middle are the sum of adjacent pairs from the previous row (1+2 and 2+1).

5. **Row 4:**
   - 1 4 6 4 1

   This represents ${(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4}$

   - The "4"s are the sum of 1 and 3, and the "6" is the sum of 3 and 3 from the previous row.

6. **Row 5:**
   - 1 5 10 10 5 1

   This represents ${(a + b)^5 = a^5 + 5a^4b + 10a^3b^2 + 10a^2b^3 + 5ab^4 + b^5}$

   - The "5"s are the sum of 1 and 4, and the "10"s are the sum of 4 and 6 from the previous row.

7. **Row 6:**
   - 1 6 15 20 15 6 1

   This represents ${(a + b)^6 = a^6 + 6a^5b + 15a^4b^2 + 20a^3b^3 + 15a^2b^4 + 6ab^5 + b^6 }$

   - The "6"s are the sum of 1 and 5, the "15"s are the sum of 5 and 10, and the "20" is the sum of 10 and 10 from the previous row.

### Key Properties of Pascal's Triangle:
- **Symmetry:** Each row is symmetric.
- **Binomial Coefficients:** Each element in row 
 ${(n)}$ corresponds to the binomial coefficient 
  ${binom((n)(k))}$ , where ${(k)}$ is the position in the row (starting from 0).
- **Sum of Rows:** The sum of the elements in row  ${( n ) is ( 2^n )}$ 

Pascal's Triangle has applications in probability, combinatorics, and algebra, particularly in binomial expansions and finding coefficients in polynomial expressions.
