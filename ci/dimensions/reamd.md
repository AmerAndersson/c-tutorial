Certainly! Let's break down and explain the given C code:

```c
int matrix[2][3] = {
    {1, 4, 2},
    {3, 6, 8}
};

int row = sizeof(matrix) / sizeof(matrix[0]);

Matrix Declaration and Initialization:

int matrix[2][3] = {
        {1, 4, 2},
        {3, 6, 8}
};

This line declares a 2x3 integer matrix named `matrix`.
It initializes the matrix with the following values:
1  4  2
3  6  8

Calculating the Number of Rows

int row = sizeof(matrix) / sizeof(matrix[0]);

`sizeof(matrix)` gives the total size in bytes of the entire matrix. 

Since each `int` is typically 4 bytes (but this can vary depending on the system),
and there are 6 integers (2 rows * 3 columns), `sizeof(matrix)` would be `6 * 4 = 24` bytes.
`sizeof(matrix[0])` gives the size in bytes of the first row of the matrix. 

Since the first row has 3 integers and each integer is 4 bytes, `sizeof(matrix[0])` 
would be `3 * 4 = 12` bytes.

To find the number of rows, you divide the total size of the matrix by the size of one row:
`sizeof(matrix) / sizeof(matrix[0]) = 24 / 12 = 2`.

So, `row` will be `2`, representing the number of rows in the matrix.

Summary:
`matrix[2][3]` is a 2x3 matrix with the specified values.
`row` calculates the number of rows in the matrix by dividing the total size of the matrix by the size of one row, resulting in `2`.

This technique is useful for determining the dimensions of an array without explicitly hardcoding them, making the code more flexible and easier to maintain.
