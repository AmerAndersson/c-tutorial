The intent is that short and long should provide different lengths of integers where practical; int will normally be the natural size for a particular machine. short is often 16 bits long, and int either 16 or 32 bits. Each compiler is free to choose appropriate sizes for its own hardware, subject only to the the restriction that shorts and ints are at least 16 bits, longs are at least 32 bits, and short is no longer than int, which is no longer than long

short 16 bits 
int 16 or 32
long 32 bits
char 8 bits
unsigned char has value between 0 and  255
signed char has value between -128 and 127
long double 
double
float

- shorts and ints are at least 16 bits and longs are at least 32 bits
- and short is no longer than int, which is no longer than long.

in a twos complement machine. Whether plain chars are signed or unsigned is machine-dependent, but printable characters are always positive.

C program that determines the ranges of various data types, both by using standard headers and by direct computation. This program will cover `char`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, and `long double`.

> Explanation:

1. **Standard Headers**:
   - `limits.h` provides macros for integer type limits (e.g., `INT_MAX`, `SCHAR_MIN`).
   - `float.h` provides macros for floating-point type limits (e.g., `FLT_MAX`).

2. **Direct Computation**:
   - The direct computation of the range of signed types is based on the idea that the maximum value is half of the bit patterns of the type (shifted right by one) and the minimum value is the negative of this maximum value minus one.
   - For unsigned types, the maximum value is simply the bitwise NOT of zero.

This program should be run on a platform that supports these types and their respective ranges as defined in the headers. The floating-point ranges are derived from the standard headers because manually computing these can be error-prone and depend heavily on the specific hardware representation.
