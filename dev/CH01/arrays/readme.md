To create a C program that prints a histogram of the lengths of words in its input, we can approach the task in two parts:

1. **Horizontal Histogram**: This is simpler and we'll start with it.
2. **Vertical Histogram**: This is more challenging and will be implemented afterwards.

### Horizontal Histogram

Here's a C program to create a horizontal histogram of word lengths:

```

### Vertical Histogram

Now, let's tackle the vertical histogram. This involves determining the maximum count of any word length and then printing from the top row downwards.

Here's the C program for a vertical histogram of word lengths:

### Vertical Histogram

For a vertical histogram, the approach is slightly different. We need to determine the maximum frequency and then print the histogram from top to bottom.


### Explanation

1. **Reading Input and Counting Frequencies:**
   - Both programs read the input character by character using `getchar()` until EOF.
   - The frequency of each character is stored in the `char_count` array.

2. **Horizontal Histogram:**
   - For each character with a count greater than zero, the program prints the character (or its hex value if it's non-printable) followed by a number of `#` symbols corresponding to its frequency.

3. **Vertical Histogram:**
   - The maximum count of any character is determined to set the height of the histogram.
   - The histogram is printed from the top row down to the bottom. For each row, it checks if the count of a character is at least as much as the row number and prints a `#` if it is; otherwise, it prints spaces.
   - After the histogram, an axis with the characters is printed for clarity. Printable characters are shown directly, and non-printable characters are shown in hexadecimal format.

These programs provide visual representations of character frequencies in both horizontal and vertical orientations. 


```c
To modify the main routine of the longest-line program to handle arbitrarily long input lines and print their lengths along with as much text as possible, you can follow these steps:

1. **Read Input Line by Line:** Handle lines of arbitrary length by dynamically managing the memory allocation.
2. **Track Length and Content:** Keep track of the length of each line and store as much of the line as possible.
3. **Output the Results:** After reading all lines, output the length of the longest line and the text.

Here is an example of how this could be implemented in C:

Explanation:
1. **Dynamic Line Reading (getline_dynamic):**
   - The function `getline_dynamic` reads a line of input, dynamically reallocating memory if the line exceeds the initial buffer size. It returns the length of the line read.

2. **Main Routine:**
   - The main function allocates initial memory for `line` and `longest`.
   - It reads lines using `getline_dynamic` and keeps track of the longest line.
   - If a longer line is found, it updates the `longest` line.

3. **Memory Management:**
   - The program ensures that memory is reallocated as needed to accommodate arbitrarily long lines.
   - Memory is freed at the end to prevent leaks.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all lines, the program prints the length and text of the longest line.

This approach ensures that the program can handle lines of any length and print the required information correctly.
