# simple implementation of a detab program in C

## Exercise 21

In C, a detab program replaces tabs in the input with the appropriate number of spaces to align with the next tab stop. The value of `n`, which determines the tab stops, can be made a variable so it can be easily changed without altering the core logic of the program.:


> Explanation

1. **Header Files**: Includes the standard I/O library for input and output operations.

2. **Macro Definition**: `DEFAULT_TAB_WIDTH` is defined as 8, which is the default tab width. This can be changed as needed.

3. **Main Function**:
    - Takes an optional command-line argument to specify a custom tab width.
    - If the argument is provided, it converts it to an integer and checks if it is valid (greater than 0).
    - If no argument is provided, it uses the default tab width.

4. **detab Function**:
    - Reads characters from the standard input one by one.
    - If a tab character (`\t`) is encountered, it calculates the number of spaces needed to reach the next tab stop and prints them.
    - If any other character is encountered, it is printed as is.
    - Keeps track of the current position (`pos`) to correctly calculate spaces when a tab is encountered.
    - Resets the position to 0 after a newline character (`\n`).

### Compilation and Execution

This program will read from the standard input and output the processed text with tabs replaced by the appropriate number of spaces.


## Exercise 21

## The entab program replaces sequences of spaces 

Sure, I can help you with that. The entab program replaces sequences of spaces with the minimum number of tabs and spaces to achieve the same spacing. To implement this in C, we will follow these steps:

Define the tab stop width.
Read input character by character.
Count the number of spaces.
When a non-space character is encountered or at the end of the input, replace the counted spaces with the appropriate number of tabs and spaces.
Here is the implementation of the entab program:

> Explanation:
Define TAB_WIDTH: We define the tab stop width as 4 (you can change it to suit your needs).
Main Function: The main function calls entab with stdin as input and stdout as output.

## entab Function:

We read characters from the input using fgetc.
When a space is encountered, we increment space_count and column.
If column is at a tab stop (i.e., column % TAB_WIDTH == 0), we output a tab and reset space_count.
For non-space characters, we first flush any pending spaces by outputting the appropriate number of tabs and spaces. Then, we output the current character.
We also handle newlines by resetting the column counter.
After the loop, if there are any remaining spaces, we flush them to the output.
This program ensures that spaces are replaced by the minimum number of tabs and spaces while respecting tab stops.

## Exercise 22

Sure, I can help you with that. Below is a C program that folds long input lines into shorter lines at the last non-blank character before the specified column number `n`.


> Explanation:

1. **Main Function**: 
    - Defines the folding column `n`.
    - Reads input lines using `get_line`.
    - Processes each line with `fold_line`.

2. **get_line Function**: 
    - Reads a line of input up to `maxline` characters or until a newline or EOF.
    - Returns the length of the line read.

3. **fold_line Function**: 
    - Iterates through each character of the input line.
    - Tracks the last blank space (space or tab) found.
    - If the current column exceeds the specified limit `n`:
        - If no blank space was found, it inserts a newline at the current position.
        - If a blank space was found, it replaces it with a newline.
    - Resets the column count when a newline character is encountered.

This program intelligently handles very long lines and folds them at the specified column limit, ensuring the folded lines are still properly formatted.


## Exercise 23

To remove all comments from a C program while properly handling quoted strings and character constants, you need to carefully parse the input to distinguish between comments and other parts of the code. Here’s a C program that performs this task:


> Explanation

1. **File Handling**: The program opens the input and output files specified in the command-line arguments.
2. **State Management**: Four boolean flags are used to track whether the parser is currently inside a string, character constant, single-line comment, or multi-line comment.
3. **Comment Removal**:
   - **Single-Line Comments**: Detected by `//` and terminated by a newline character.
   - **Multi-Line Comments**: Detected by `/*` and terminated by `*/`.
4. **String and Character Constants**: Ensure that quotes inside strings and character constants are handled correctly by checking if a quote is part of a string/character or ends it.
5. **Ungetc**: Used to put back characters that were read ahead to make decisions but are not part of a comment.

### Usage:
Compile the program and run it with the input and output file names as arguments.

## Exercise 24

Creating a C program to check for rudimentary syntax errors such as unmatched parentheses, brackets, braces, quotes, escape sequences, and comments can be quite complex, but let's approach it step by step. We'll focus on:

1. Parentheses `()`
2. Brackets `[]`
3. Braces `{}`
4. Single and double quotes
5. Escape sequences
6. Comments (both single-line and multi-line)

Here’s a simplified version of such a checker in C:

> Explanation

- **Stack**: A simple stack data structure is used to keep track of opening parentheses, brackets, and braces.
- **State Variables**:
  - `in_single_quote`, `in_double_quote`, `in_comment`: To keep track of whether we're inside quotes or comments.
  - `escape`: To handle escape sequences.
- **Reading Input**: The program reads characters one by one using `getchar()`.
  - When it encounters an opening symbol (`(`, `{`, `[`), it pushes it onto the stack.
  - When it encounters a closing symbol (`)`, `}`, `]`), it pops from the stack and checks if it matches the corresponding opening symbol.
  - It handles single-line and multi-line comments, as well as string literals and character literals.
- **Final Check**: After reading the entire input, it checks if there are any unmatched symbols left in the stack.

This code handles basic cases and can be extended for more complex scenarios if needed.
